# Contributing

## Code of conduct

We welcome contributions from everyone, and to ensure our community stays open and healthy
we adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), a widely
used [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) adopted by many other communities such as
Linux, Ruby on Rails, and GitLab.

Everyone participating in the Autoware community is expected to follow the code of conduct.

If someone in the community happens to be violating these terms, please let the project
leads know, and we will address it as soon as possible.
